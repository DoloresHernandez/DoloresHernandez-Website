        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a third year at the University of California Riverside majoring in Political Science. Ive gained experience in a wide range of fields such as Event Planning, Waitress, Babysitting as well as House Cleaning. Working in these fields have helped me expand my knowledge. I've learned many things in my past internships as well. I was able to experience the behind the scenes of the music industry as well as the entertainment industry overall. This has been an industry I have always been curious about as music has been a very big interest of mine. Listening to music and making my own playlists dedicating each one to a different genre is something that brings me happiness.<br><br>

        I listen to a variety of genres regardless of language barriers because its something I enjoy listening to, music is something that breaks those barriers for me as I dance along to it knowing its a group I absolutely admire. There are times where the artist becomes a role model to me and seeing the mistreatment from their own companies is what inspired me to pursue a career in the field. I would like to be someone who defends these artists against their labels when done wrong. Many labels have no idea how to properly promote their groups and its disappointing as a fan to see. Being a part of a younger generation means having an idea as to what the fans want to see and what types of experiences make these moments unforgettable. These are also things I'd like to be a part of. I want to make sure that record labels aren't just using these artists for their benefit but to benefit the artist as well. I want the entertainment industry to be equal in terms of it benefiting both sides. I want to help the industry become better making artists feel more secure and non regretful in their decision to sign.<br><br>

         All past experiences have helped me in their own manner and currently my only "profession" is being a student as i continue my job search. Being a student is a job all on it's own. It teaches you to be more responsible with your time as well as being responsible in terms of making sure all your assignments are turned in on time meeting deadlines daily. It has also taught me to become a morning person, I have learned that the earlier you decide to do things the more time you will have to yourself. I have become someone that enjoys doing her tasks and crossing them off is very satisying. Wether it be babysitting or planning a big event for a company, I find every moment to be very important in doing well in as it will be an experience that will further help in the future. I hope to continue finding internships that will provide me with much more experience as well as continuing to expand my knowledge within every field I continue to find interest in.
